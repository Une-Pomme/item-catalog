# Iten Catalog
My submission for the item catalog project was written with Python 2.7 and Flask. 

## Usage
Before running the catalog application, you need to run two python files to set up the database for the web appliation.

```
python database_setup.py
python filldatabase.py
```

Then type the following in the command line.
```
python application.py
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/catalog/ in a web browser.
